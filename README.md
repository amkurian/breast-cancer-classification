# breast-cancer-classification

Predict if a cancer diagonsis is malignant or benign by classifying several features and observation.

Data Set Characteristics:

:Number of Instances: 569

:Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

:Attribute Information:
    - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    - perimeter
    - area
    - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
    - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
    - symmetry 
    - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

    The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
    largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
    resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
    13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

    - class:
            - WDBC-Malignant
            - WDBC-Benign
